83% of developers* are concerned with the security of open-source code. You’re probably among that 83%. </br>

You’ve got nothing to worry about with hapi.
When you npm install @hapi/hapi, every single line of code you get has been verified. You never have to worry about some deep dependency being poorly maintained (or handed over to someone sketchy). hapi is the only leading node framework without any external code dependencies. None.

# How do we keep hapi secure?

* End-to-end Code Hygiene — hapi requires the most secure settings to manage, control, and distribute code, including 2FA for all contributors.
* Secure Defaults, Updated Regularly — every hapi component comes with the most secure defaults out-of-the-box. Along with protecting server load with payload limits and request timeouts, hapi blocks error messages that could leak information or echo back exploits.
* Integrated Authorization and Authentication Architecture — the most comprehensive authorization and authentication API available in a Node framework.
* Advanced Features — with encrypted and signed cookies, secret or key rotation, and HTTP security headers, there are no excuses for building insecure applications.
* Reliable, Predictable Ownership – when something goes wrong, you know who to contact. Security updates are handled under a strict, well-defined protocol.
